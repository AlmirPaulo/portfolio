            <h3>The links will lead you to where you can check the testimonials.</h3>
            <blockquote>Almir helped me translate my game called "Satan's Pepper" into Portuguese. After the game went viral on platforms like Itch.io and YouTube, I was contacted by Almir, who volunteered to translate my creation into Portuguese - the only available language at the time was English.

I had a pleasure to work with Almir: the communication with him was fast and professional, his technical skills also made working with Almir easier, because he could easily understand how the game's data files worked without a huge need to explain processes in detail. The translations themselves were also of excellent quality, which resulted in a large number of Portuguese-speaking players enjoying my game.

I'm extremely grateful to Almir for his help in making my game accessible to a wider audience. Without hesitation, I recommend him as a translator. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/almirpaulo/' target='_blank'><i>Paulius Geƒças</i></a></blockquote>
<blockquote>Almir did a fantastic job translating a piece of ours to Portuguese, Absolutely wonderful to work with. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/almirpaulo/' target='_blank'><i>Farbod Ardebili</i></a></blockquote>
<blockquote>Almir was always great to work with. I asked for more input and it was very helpful. <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/u/AlmirPaul0" target="_blank"><i>Michelle Sauceda</i></blockquote></a>

        <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
				<h3>What TEP stands for?</h3>
				<p>Translation, Editing and Proofreading. In my case you can consider the "T" as "Transcribing" too.</p>
        <h3>What languages do you work with?</h3>
        <p>By now, <strong>Spanish</strong> and <strong>English</strong>. I rather translate to my native tongue: <strong>Brazilian Portuguese</strong>, but if you give me a little more time I can translate in other directions. Also, I often can handle other variants of the same languages, like the European Portuguese.</p>
				<h3>Do you sign NDAs?</h3>
				<p>Sure. If it's a reasonable one.</p>
         <h3>Would you accept to be paid directly via Paypal or Wire Transfer?</h3>
        <p>If you were on behalf of a company/agency or if I could trust you in some way, then yes, I would. And <strong>if I cold pitch you</strong>, then certainly I would accept.</p>
        <h3>But if I'm not on behalf of an agency or company, how can I hire you?</h3>
				<p>You can hire me via <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/u/AlmirPaul0" target="_blank">Freelancer</a>.</p>
        <h3>How fast you can deliver?</h3>
        <p>I understand you might be in a hurry, but to deliver a high quality work everybody needs time. It's not reasonable to request a TEP work of 10,000 words for the day. It doesn't matter how fast I can type, TEP work also demands attention, research, sometimes a review, so don't be so frivolous and allow me the proper time.</p>
        <p>That said, 2000 words daily is a good expectation.</p>
        <h3>Can we meet on Zoom/Skype or talk on Telegram/Whatsapp?</h3>
        <p>Sure, but email me first. Explain me a bit about your project.</p>
